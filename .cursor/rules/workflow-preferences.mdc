# Coding workflow preferences

- When creating a new project, create a development journal markdown file and use it as journal to help keep track of the project, milestones and conversations with user (me). 
- When adding entries into the development journal, be thorough and always append to it, dont delete anything.
- When resuming work on an existing project, refer to that development journal markdown file and continue with the remaining tasks listed in the journal.
- Focus on the ares of code relevant to the task
- Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed
- Always think about what other methods/functions and areas of code might be affected by code changes
- Always write a detailed documentation in a /docs folder on every major feature you build. Create an overview.md that indexes all of the docs created
