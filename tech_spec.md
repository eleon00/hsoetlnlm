# Technical Specification: HSOETLNLM (HVR-like Application)

Based on the sources and conversation history, here is a detailed technical specification for your HVR-like application using Go, a relational database for metadata, Temporal for orchestration, and Benthos as the integration engine:

**1. Overall Architecture**

The application will follow a modular architecture with the following key components:

*   **Go Backend Application:** This will be the central control plane responsible for:
    *   Providing an API (likely RESTful) for users to define, manage, and monitor replication tasks.
    *   Interacting with the metadata database to store and retrieve configuration.
    *   Communicating with the Temporal cluster to manage workflow executions.
    *   Orchestrating the execution of Benthos pipelines.
*   **Metadata Database (SQL Server or similar RDBMS):** This database will store all the necessary configuration and state for the application, including:
    *   Connection details for source and target systems (Oracle, SQL Server, S3, local files, BigQuery, Snowflake).
    *   Definitions of replication tasks (source, target, data selection criteria, transformation rules).
    *   Scheduling information for replication tasks.
    *   Status and history of replication runs.
    *   Configuration details for Temporal and Benthos.
*   **Temporal Cluster:** This will be responsible for orchestrating the long-running workflows associated with each replication task, including scheduling, retries, and state management.
*   **Benthos Instances:** These will be stateless data processing pipelines responsible for extracting data from sources, transforming it, and loading it into the destination (Snowflake). The Go backend will manage the configuration and potentially the lifecycle of these instances.

**2. Metadata Database Schema (Conceptual)**

The following tables are a conceptual outline and would need to be refined based on specific requirements:

*   **`Connections`:**
    *   `ID` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `Name` (VARCHAR, Unique)
    *   `Type` (VARCHAR, e.g., 'oracle', 'sqlserver', 's3', 'bigquery', 'snowflake', 'localfile')
    *   `ConnectionString` (VARCHAR) - Stores connection details (e.g., JDBC URL, AWS credentials, file paths, BigQuery project ID).
    *   `CreatedAt` (DATETIME)
    *   `UpdatedAt` (DATETIME)
*   **`ReplicationTasks`:**
    *   `ID` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `Name` (VARCHAR, Unique)
    *   `SourceConnectionID` (INT, Foreign Key referencing `Connections.ID`)
    *   `TargetConnectionID` (INT, Foreign Key referencing `Connections.ID`)
    *   `Schedule` (VARCHAR, e.g., cron expression)
    *   `DataSelectionCriteria` (TEXT, e.g., SQL WHERE clause, file patterns)
    *   `TransformationRules` (TEXT, e.g., Benthos Bloblang configuration snippets)
    *   `TemporalWorkflowID` (VARCHAR, Stores the ID of the associated Temporal Workflow instance)
    *   `Status` (VARCHAR, e.g., 'active', 'inactive', 'failed')
    *   `CreatedAt` (DATETIME)
    *   `UpdatedAt` (DATETIME)
*   **`ReplicationRuns`:**
    *   `ID` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `ReplicationTaskID` (INT, Foreign Key referencing `ReplicationTasks.ID`)
    *   `StartTime` (DATETIME)
    *   `EndTime` (DATETIME)
    *   `Status` (VARCHAR, e.g., 'running', 'success', 'failed')
    *   `ErrorDetails` (TEXT)
    *   `TemporalRunID` (VARCHAR, Stores the Run ID of the associated Temporal Workflow execution)
    *   `CreatedAt` (DATETIME)
*   **`BenthosConfigurations`:**
    *   `ID` (INT, Primary Key)
    *   `Name` (VARCHAR, Unique)
    *   `Configuration` (TEXT, Stores the Benthos YAML or JSON configuration)
    *   `CreatedAt` (DATETIME)
    *   `UpdatedAt` (DATETIME)
*   **`TaskBenthosConfigMapping`:** (Many-to-many relationship between `ReplicationTasks` and `BenthosConfigurations`)
    *   `ReplicationTaskID` (INT, Foreign Key referencing `ReplicationTasks.ID`)
    *   `BenthosConfigID` (INT, Foreign Key referencing `BenthosConfigurations.ID`)
    *   `Order` (INT, to define the order of Benthos pipelines if multiple are used for a single task)
    *   `PRIMARY KEY (ReplicationTaskID, BenthosConfigID)`

**3. Go Backend Application**

The Go backend will be structured with the following layers:

*   **API Layer (Controllers/Handlers):**
    *   Handles incoming HTTP requests for managing connections, replication tasks, and monitoring.
    *   Validates user input.
    *   Interacts with the Service Layer.
    *   Returns responses to the user (e.g., JSON).
*   **Service Layer:**
    *   Contains the core business logic of the application.
    *   Interacts with the Data Access Layer to manage data in the metadata database.
    *   Communicates with the Temporal client to start, stop, and query Temporal Workflows.
    *   Handles the generation and management of Benthos configurations.
    *   Potentially manages the deployment and lifecycle of Benthos instances (e.g., using container orchestration like Docker and Kubernetes, or by directly executing Benthos processes).
*   **Data Access Layer (Repositories/DAOs):**
    *   Provides an abstraction over the metadata database.
    *   Implements methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the database tables.
*   **Temporal Client:**
    *   A client library (e.g., the official Go SDK for Temporal) used to interact with the Temporal cluster.
    *   Responsible for registering Workflow and Activity definitions (though these might be defined within the Go backend itself).
*   **Benthos Management:**
    *   Modules responsible for generating Benthos configuration files based on the `ReplicationTasks` and `BenthosConfigurations` in the metadata store.
    *   Potentially includes logic for starting, stopping, and monitoring Benthos processes (depending on the chosen deployment model for Benthos).

**4. Temporal Integration**

Temporal will be used to orchestrate the replication workflows:

*   **Workflow Definitions (in Go):** Define Temporal Workflows in Go that represent the lifecycle of a replication task. A typical workflow might include steps like:
    *   Retrieving the replication task configuration from the metadata database.
    *   Generating the appropriate Benthos configuration.
    *   Triggering the execution of the Benthos pipeline (as a Temporal Activity or by other means).
    *   Monitoring the status of the Benthos pipeline.
    *   Handling retries in case of failures.
    *   Updating the status of the replication run in the metadata database.
    *   Potentially implementing scheduling logic if not handled externally (though Temporal has robust scheduling capabilities).
*   **Activities (in Go):** Define Temporal Activities in Go that perform specific tasks within the workflow, such as:
    *   Generating the Benthos configuration file.
    *   Interacting with a Benthos management service or directly starting/stopping Benthos processes.
    *   Updating the metadata database.
*   **Temporal Client Interaction:** The Go backend's Service Layer will use the Temporal client to:
    *   Start new Workflow executions when a replication task is created or scheduled.
    *   Signal existing Workflows (if needed for manual control or event-based triggers).
    *   Query Workflow status and history for monitoring purposes.

**5. Benthos Integration**

Benthos will handle the actual data integration:

*   **Configuration Generation:** The Go backend will dynamically generate Benthos configuration files based on the source and target connection details, data selection criteria, and transformation rules defined in the metadata database for each `ReplicationTask`. This configuration will define the input connector (e.g., potentially CDC for Oracle and SQL Server, `aws_s3`, `file`, `gcp_bigquery_select`), any necessary processors for data transformation (`mapping`, `jq`, `bloblang`, `sql`), and the `snowflake_put` or `snowflake_streaming` output connector.
*   **Execution Management:** The Go backend will need a strategy to execute the generated Benthos configurations. This could involve:
    *   **Containerized Benthos:** Packaging Benthos as a Docker container and using an orchestration platform (like Kubernetes) to manage instances, with the Go backend triggering deployments or sending configuration.
    *   **Direct Process Execution:** The Go backend could directly execute the Benthos binary with the generated configuration file as an argument.
    *   **Benthos as a Service:** If Benthos is deployed as a long-running service with an API, the Go backend could interact with this API to deploy and manage pipelines.
*   **Monitoring:** The Go backend will need to monitor the health and performance of the Benthos pipelines. This could involve:
    *   Parsing Benthos logs.
    *   Collecting metrics exposed by Benthos (if configured).
    *   Receiving status updates from the Benthos execution environment.

**6. Replication Task Definition and Management**

Users will interact with the Go backend (via the API or a potential UI built on top of it) to:

*   **Define Connections:** Create and manage connections to source (Oracle, SQL Server, S3, local files, BigQuery) and target (Snowflake) systems by providing the necessary connection details. These details will be securely stored in the metadata database.
*   **Define Replication Tasks:** Create and manage replication tasks by specifying:
    *   A name for the task.
    *   The source and target connections to use.
    *   Data selection criteria (e.g., specific tables or files, filtering conditions).
    *   Optional data transformation rules using Benthos processors (e.g., mapping fields, data type conversions, applying functions).
    *   A schedule for the replication task (e.g., using cron expressions).
*   **Manage Replication Tasks:** Start, stop, enable, disable, and delete replication tasks.
*   **Monitor Replication Runs:** View the status and history of past and current replication runs, including start and end times, status (success/failed), and any error details. This information will be retrieved from the metadata database and potentially by querying Temporal.

**7. Monitoring and Logging**

The application will incorporate monitoring and logging at various levels:

*   **Go Backend:** Application logs for tracking internal operations and API requests. Health checks for monitoring the availability of the Go backend. Metrics (e.g., request latency, error rates) for performance monitoring.
*   **Temporal:** Temporal provides its own Web UI and metrics for monitoring Workflow and Activity execution. These can be used to track the status and history of replication tasks managed by Temporal.
*   **Benthos:** Benthos can be configured to output logs and metrics. These logs will be crucial for debugging data integration issues. Metrics can provide insights into data throughput and processing performance.
*   **Metadata Database:** Monitoring the health and performance of the metadata database is also essential.

**8. Error Handling**

Robust error handling will be implemented throughout the application:

*   **Go Backend:** Implement proper error handling for API requests, database interactions, and communication with Temporal and Benthos. Return meaningful error messages to the user.
*   **Temporal:** Temporal's built-in retry mechanisms for Workflows and Activities will ensure resilience in case of transient failures. Workflows can also implement custom error handling logic.
*   **Benthos:** Benthos has error handling capabilities within its processing pipelines. Errors during data processing can be logged and potentially handled by routing data to dead-letter queues or other error handling outputs.
*   **Metadata Database:** Implement appropriate error handling for database operations, including connection errors and query failures.

**Note:** The specific implementation details for each component will require further refinement based on your exact requirements and the chosen technologies. Investigation into the specific CDC capabilities of Benthos for Oracle and SQL Server is required for real-time data replication from those sources.
